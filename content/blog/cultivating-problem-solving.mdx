Developing resilient problem-solvers requires intentional practice, reflection, and community.

## Routines

- Warm-ups that emphasize reasoning
- Think-alouds to model strategy choice
- Reflection prompts after challenges

```ts
function fibonacci(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 1) return n
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}
```
